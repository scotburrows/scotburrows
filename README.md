Hello! I'm Scot Burrows, a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I'm an aspiring game developer, with a few team projects under my belt so far and more to come. I enjoy coding for games and collaborating with teams to design a game. I am currently learning all I can at my current skill level. 

I've so far developed two games in GameMaker in a team of four: Students of Mars and The Spiral Root, developed in about 6 weeks each in GameMaker. Both games can be viewed on my profile.
